 will help me be a better developer for my next project. And theres a lot of mistakes -_-]

This a simple piece of software that explorers and tries to simulate the behaviour of living creatures.
These "Critters" are the small circles within the main window, moving around the screen and performing other 
functions that a living creature would. This project is still very young, so if theres a problem feel free
to post it on the GitHub page: https://github.com/Tamilist/Bit-Critters
